## Features and Description


Description:
Developed a network port scanner tool in Python to identify open ports on a given host or range of hosts. This tool utilizes the socket library to establish connections and scan for open ports within a specified range. Additionally, it includes error handling to handle connection timeouts and exceptions gracefully.

Features:
1. Scan single or multiple hosts for open ports.
2. Specify a range of ports to scan.
3. Handle timeouts and exceptions gracefully.
4. Display results indicating open ports.



..This project demonstrates your ability to work with network sockets in Python and your understanding of network security concepts such as port scanning. Make sure to customize and enhance it further according to your needs and skills.
